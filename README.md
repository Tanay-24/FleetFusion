# FleetFusion
The Fleet Fusion is a project designed to develop a computerized system to efficiently manage the operations of a transport service that provides vehicles to users. This proposed application will
describe the features and quality of the transport service.
The main aim of the transport provider is to offer reliable and well-maintained vehicles to users. The system will also include an admin interface through which the manager can add and manage vehicles,
handle vehicle orders, and send email notifications to users.
Currently, many transport service providers handle their vehicle management and order processing manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. With a computerized system, the same tasks
can be completed more efficiently and accurately, reducing the effort and manpower required.
There is a need for such software to automate the management of transport services, making the entire process more streamlined and reliable. This software would integrate functionalities such as
vehicle addition, order management, and email notifications into a single platform, offering significant benefits to transport service providers.
